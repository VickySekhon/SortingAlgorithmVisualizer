## Project Description
This project is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built using Python and the Tkinter library. It provides a graphical representation of various sorting algorithms, allowing users to observe and understand how each algorithm works.

The implemented sorting algorithms include:

- Shell Sort
- Merge Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Bubble Sort

The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on experience for users to visualize the sorting process and gain insights into the efficiency and mechanics of different sorting algorithms.

## How to Install and Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory - cd SortingAlgorithmVisualizer
3. Install the required dependencies - pip install tkinter
4. Run the main script - python main.py

## How to Use the Project

Upon running the application, a graphical interface will appear. Choose a sorting algorithm from the available options and set the desired speed of visualization.

Click the "Visualize" button to see the sorting algorithm in action.

Observe the visual representation of the sorting process.
